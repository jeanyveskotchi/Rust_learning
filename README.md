# 🦀 Rust Learning Journey

This repository contains my daily Rust practice as I learn the language from scratch.
Most exercises come from Exercism’s Rust track, along with small experiments, notes, and snippets that help me understand Rust’s ownership, borrowing, pattern matching, and other core concepts.

## What’s Inside

Daily Exercism solutions (/exercism_solutions)

Small Rust experiments & helper functions

Notes on concepts I struggled with or found interesting

Progress updates as I build Rust fundamentals

## Why Rust?

I discovered Rust recently and instantly fell in love with it — and with its community mascot, Ferris 🦀.
Since then, I’ve been learning Rust every day because:

It’s been the most loved programming language since 2016 (StackOverflow Developer Survey)

It aligns perfectly with my long-term goals in cybersecurity, systems programming, and high-performance code

It’s fun, modern, and challenging in the best way

## How I Learn

Solving Exercism challenges daily

Watching long-form tutorials

Reading Rust docs & experimenting with small snippets

Building intuition around ownership, borrowing, and error handling
